Unveiling the dynamics of antimicrobial utilization and resistance in a large hospital network over five years: Insights from health record data analysis

Abstract 
** Background **: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) presents a pressing public health challenge globally which has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Elucidation of the impact of the pandemic on AMR evolution using population-level data that integrates clinical, laboratory and prescription data remains lacking. 
** Methods ** : Data was extracted from the centralized electronic platform which captures the health records of 60,551 patients across the network of public healthcare facilities in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. For all inpatients and outpatients diagnosed with bacterial infection between 01/01/2017 and 31/05/2022, structured and unstructured Electronic Health Record data, microbiological laboratory data including antibiogram, molecular typing and COVID-19 testing information as well as antibiotic prescribing data were extracted curated and linked. Various analytical methods, including time-series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised clustering algorithms, were employed to investigate the trends of antimicrobial usage and resistance over time, assess the impact of prescription practices on resistance rates, and explore the effects of COVID-19 on antimicrobial usage and resistance. 
** Results **: Our findings identified a significant impact of COVID-19 on antimicrobial prescription practices, with short-term and long-lasting over-prescription of these drugs. Resistance to antimicrobials increased the odds ratio of mortality to an average of 2.5 and the effects of prescription practices on resistance were observed within one week of initiation. Significant trends in antimicrobial resistance, exhibiting fluctuations for various drugs and organisms, with an overall increasing trend in resistance levels, particularly post-COVI D-19 were identified.
